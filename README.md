This page demonstrates a quick Hard Drive formatting barrier in Windows 11 Home I had to overcome while preparing another computer with more storage for Virtualbox use. Using the following website as guidance, I quickly resolved the issue.

I had an extra Seagate 1TB HDD plugged into my computer, but the OS was not reading it:

Following the website, I went to Settings > System > Storage > Disks & Volumes and saw my 1TB drive was currently online, but unallocated and needed to be formatted with NTFS for use.

AFter making the formatting changes, the drive was labled with NTFS, Healthy and Basic Partition. The was then seen in the file explorer where it previously wasn't.
